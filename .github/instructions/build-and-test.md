# Build & Test

**Bazel is the primary build system.**

## Commands

```bash
# Build specific target
bazel build //score/gatewayd:gatewayd

# Run all tests
bazel test //...

# Run unit tests
bazel test //score/...

# Run integration tests
bazel test //tests/integration:integration

# Run performance benchmarks
bazel test //tests/benchmarks:all
```

## Test Requirements

When adding new code, tests are required by default:
- Unit tests next to the software element's source code
- Use `py_pytest` rule for Python tests

## pre-commit

pre-commit must pass, before considering the work done:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```
