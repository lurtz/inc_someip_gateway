Shared Memory Slot Manager
==========================

The Gateway IPC binding uses shared memory as its data plane. Control messages travel over ``score::message_passing``, while event payload bytes live in shared memory and are referenced by ``Shared_memory_handle``.

Current design
--------------

The binding does not maintain one global payload pool. Instead, it creates shared-memory managers per service instance.

- each side owns writable shared memory for the services it publishes over the binding
- peer memory is opened read-only on demand using ``Shared_memory_metadata``
- payload ownership is tracked on the sender side until the receiver signals ``Payload_consumed``

This per-service split matches the code in ``Shared_memory_managers`` and keeps shared-memory sizing configurable for each service/instance pair.

Main types
----------

``Shared_memory_slot_manager``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Writable manager used by the local side.

- allocates fixed-size slots
- exposes slot memory for writing payload bytes
- reference-counts shared ownership of a slot
- returns a ``Shared_memory_slot_guard`` for RAII cleanup

``Read_only_shared_memory_slot_manager``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read-only view used for a peer's shared-memory pool.

- opens a pool from ``Shared_memory_metadata``
- constructs a ``score::socom::Payload`` from the shared memory span represented by ``Shared_memory_handle``
- triggers a destruction callback when the payload wrapper is released locally

``Shared_memory_manager_factory``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Abstract factory used by the binding to:

- create writable managers for local service instances
- open read-only managers for peer service instances

Lifetime model
--------------

The intended lifetime is:

1. allocate a writable slot for an outgoing payload
2. write bytes into the slot memory
3. send an IPC control message that references the slot via ``Shared_memory_handle``
4. retain ownership until the receiver is done
5. release the slot after ``Payload_consumed``

On the receiving side:

1. resolve the service mapping to peer ``Shared_memory_metadata``
2. open or reuse a read-only manager for that shared-memory path
3. wrap the referenced slot as a SOCom payload
4. send ``Payload_consumed`` when that payload wrapper is destroyed

How the binding uses it today
-----------------------------

Sending event updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a local ``score::socom::Client_connector`` produces an event update:

- the binding allocates a slot from the writable manager for that service key
- the payload is stored in ``m_shared_memory_allocations`` to keep it alive
- ``Event_update`` is sent with the local slot index and used byte count

Receiving event updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When an ``Event_update`` arrives:

- the binding looks up the peer metadata by ``required_id``
- it opens the peer shared-memory pool read-only if needed
- it creates a payload object from the referenced slot
- that payload object's destruction callback sends ``Payload_consumed``

Important implementation details
--------------------------------

- ``Shared_memory_handle`` contains ``slot_index`` and ``used_bytes``; there is no byte offset field in the current protocol
- ``Payload_consumed`` includes ``required_id``, allowing the sender to map reclamation to the correct service key
- shared-memory metadata exchange happens during ``Connect_service`` and ``Connect_service_reply``, not during the initial ``Connect``
- the writable allocation table is currently keyed first by service key and then by slot handle

Current limitations
-------------------

The code contains a few constraints worth documenting explicitly:

- only the event-update path currently uses shared memory end to end; method payload transport is not implemented yet

Minimal usage example
---------------------

.. code-block:: cpp

   auto manager_result = Shared_memory_slot_manager::create("/service_shm", 8, 4096);
   if (!manager_result) {
       return manager_result.error();
   }

   auto& manager = **manager_result;
   auto guard_result = manager.allocate_slot();
   if (!guard_result) {
       return guard_result.error();
   }

   auto guard = std::move(*guard_result);
   auto memory = guard.get_memory();
   auto handle_result = guard.get_handle();
   if (!handle_result) {
       return handle_result.error();
   }

   std::memcpy(memory.data(), payload_bytes, payload_size);

   Shared_memory_handle handle{
       *handle_result,
       payload_size,
   };

   // Send handle in Event_update or another payload-carrying IPC message.
