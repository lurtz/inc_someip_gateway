# SOME/IP Gateway — Agent Instructions

The S-CORE SOME/IP Gateway bridges the SCORE middleware with SOME/IP communication stacks (C++, Rust examples, Python integration tests).

## Essentials

| What | Value |
|------|-------|
| Build system | **Bazel** |
| Build | `bazel build //score/...` |
| Unit tests | `bazel test //score/...` |
| Test all | `bazel test //...` |
| Integration tests | `bazel test //tests/integration:integration` |
| Compile commands | `bazel run //:bazel-compile-commands` |

## Universal Rules

- **License headers**: All source files must have the Apache 2.0 header. Always add it when editing a file that's missing one.
- **Tests required**: New code must include tests (unit tests co-located).
- **Temporary files**: Use `.llm_tmp/` at repo root. Never use `/tmp`. This directory is ephemeral — overwrite freely without confirmation.

## Detailed Instructions

Topic-specific guidelines are in [.github/instructions/](.github/instructions/):

| File | Scope | Content |
|------|-------|---------|
| [agent-behavior.md](.github/instructions/agent-behavior.md) | All tasks | Think before coding, simplicity, surgical changes, goal-driven execution |
| [architecture.md](.github/instructions/architecture.md) | `score/**` | Components, IPC boundary, ASIL separation, external dependencies |
| [code-style.md](.github/instructions/code-style.md) | `*.cpp,*.h,*.rs,*.py` | License header template, C++ conventions, style application rules |
| [build-and-test.md](.github/instructions/build-and-test.md) | `BUILD*`, `tests/**` | Full Bazel command reference, test requirements |
| [project-structure.md](.github/instructions/project-structure.md) | `score/**` | Directory layout, config management, logging, example patterns |
| [contributing.md](.github/instructions/contributing.md) | `.github/**` | PR templates, Eclipse Foundation rules |
