# Fix Failing Test

## When to Use
- A Bazel test target is failing or flaky
- A test crashes (segfault, abort, timeout, exit 130)
- You need to make a specific test pass without breaking others

## Procedure

### 1. Reproduce the Failure
```bash
# Run the specific test in isolation
bazel test <target> --test_output=all

# For flaky tests, run multiple times
bazel test <target> --runs_per_test=5 --test_output=all
```
- Capture the full error message, assertion, or signal (SIGSEGV, SIGABRT, exit 130).
- Note whether the failure is deterministic or intermittent (flaky).
- Consider installing the `stress` apt package and using the `stress` command to increase system load and make timing-sensitive flakes more likely to reproduce.

### 2. Read the Test and Production Code
- Open the test file and the unit(s) under test.
- Understand what the test is asserting and the expected sequence of operations.
- For C++ tests: check `gtest` assertions, mock expectations, and RAII lifetimes.
- For Python tests: check pytest fixtures in `conftest.py` and any `vsomeip.json` configs.

### 3. Classify the Failure

| Symptom | Likely Cause |
|---------|-------------|
| Assertion failure on state | Wrong initial state or missed transition |
| Crash / SIGSEGV | Use-after-free, dangling ref, uninitialized memory |
| Mock expectation not met | Missing call, wrong order, or wrong argument matcher |
| Timeout / deadlock | Missing notify, wrong condition variable, lock inversion |
| Flaky (passes sometimes) | Race condition, reconnect/retry timing, test isolation leak |

### 4. Check Repo Memory
- Read `/memories/repo/` for known flaky-test patterns in this codebase before deep-diving into the code. Known patterns are recorded there to avoid re-discovering them.

### 5. Implement the Fix
- Make the **minimum change** that fixes the root cause.
- Do not change unrelated code, add logging, or refactor.

### 6. Verify
```bash
# Confirm the target test passes
bazel test <target> --test_output=all

# Run the full test suite to check for regressions
bazel test //...
```
- For flaky fixes: run several times (`--runs_per_test=10`) to confirm stability and optionally use the `stress` command to increase system load and make timing-sensitive flakes more likely to reproduce.

### 7. Record New Patterns
- If the root cause was non-obvious or flaky, add a bullet to the relevant file under `/memories/repo/` so future agents avoid the same investigation.

## Project-Specific Notes
- **Build system**: Bazel — always use `bazel test`, not direct binary execution, to get correct runfiles and sandbox.
- **Integration tests**: live under `//tests/integration`; require two daemons (`gatewayd` + `someipd`) and vsomeip config from `tests/integration/vsomeip-local.json`.
- **Python tests**: use `py_pytest` rule; run with `bazel test //tests/integration:integration --test_output=all`.
- **License headers**: any new source file must include the Apache 2.0 header from `AGENTS.md`.
