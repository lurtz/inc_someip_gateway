# Gateway IPC Binding

Gateway IPC Binding bridges SOCom service discovery and event transport across a local IPC link.
It combines:

- a control channel built on ``score::message_passing``
- per-service shared memory segments for payload transport
- a ``score::socom::Runtime`` bridge registration on each side

The implementation is intentionally symmetric after the control channel is established: both peers can request services, offer services, subscribe to events, and publish event updates. In the deployed topology, ``someipd`` typically hosts ``Gateway_ipc_binding_server`` and ``gatewayd`` typically hosts ``Gateway_ipc_binding_client``.

## Design

[The design](doc/index.rst) describes the behavior and architecture of the Gateway IPC Binding.
